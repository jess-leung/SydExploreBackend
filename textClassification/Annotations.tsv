Lion King	Awesome Night	What a great show, from end to end this was a spectacular not to be missed the costumes were wonderful and we were entertained I this wonderful theater all night. I'm not a musical show type of guy but thoroughly enjoyed myself.	Fun
Lion King	Great Show	The Lion King was an excellent show, stuck to the movie story, very good acting, costumes great and animals seemingly bought to life, Music great. The whole experience was excellent worth seeing for adults and kids alike.	Fun
Lion King	Pure Fun - Great Entertainment	A brilliant show that was great entertainment from start to finish. The animal creations were stunning - totally in love with the giraffes and the cheetah - and the way that the actors worked with the puppetry while singing and dancing! The different ways in which scenes were created was very clever - loved the 'long grass'. It was a spectacle in the true sense and all of us from my teenage daughter to my elderly father thoroughly enjoyed the show!	Fun
Lion King	Brilliant	I highly recommend it for all especially families with kids. The whole production was top quality. The cast was highly skilled and played the different roles very nicely. The music and dancing was extremely entertaining. My kids have enjoyed it tremendously.	Social
Lion King	The Best Musical Production Yet!	I saw this show in July with a couple of friends. I did not want it to end. The costumes with their glorious vivid colours , combined with the stunning effects of puppet designs and animal masks were simply amazing. The whole experience was heightened with unforgettable music. It was set against The Serengi Plains, elephant puppets came down the aisles, visuals also appeared in the dress circle, as well the stage, so all your senses are involved! It was obvious that the movements of the animals had been studied as they were perfect, I particularly enjoyed the cheetah with her smooth creeping movements. The giraffes also were amazing.	Fun
Sydney Harbour	Tres Bien	Nice place if you have free time with friends, have a drink with nice view. Have a breakfast or a dinner after visit the opera house.	Hungry
Sydney Harbour	Sydney Harbour billiance	How is Sydney the best most beautiful brash city in the world. because of its harbour. Always a gem always beautiful, always accessible and watchable.	Natural
Sydney Harbour	If you in Sydney you simply must visit the Harbour	It's Sydney's pearl. Whether you walk around it on one of the excellent walks, take a ferry or book a spot on a yacht, or have a meal in a harbourside restaurant, you must experience it.For the walks, there's several on the north, from Cremorne through Mosman to the Zoo, then on to Balmoral, or on the south side Nielssen Park to Watsons Bay (start with a cup of tea at the Kiosk at Nielssen Parl and end with a beer and fish and chips at Watsons Bay pub) but my pick is the Spit to Manly walk. Take a bus to the Spit, then set off on the bash-walk - diving doen in to deep bush, under waterfalls, out on to headlands with magnificnat ocean views, then back in to bush, and so on. The last descent in to Manly has one of the best views in Sydney. When you get to Manly take a ferry back to the city and see Sydney Harbour by water. Allow about 3 hours for the walk to take it slow and enjoy the view.Or take the ferry first to Manly, walk the other way, and have lunch at the beautiful Plonk! Restaurant at Spit. Plonk! is by the water, on the sand, and you can watch the fishermen, sailors, divers, kayaksrs and holidays makers go by. A beautiful afternoon - and exercise as well!	Adventurous
Sydney Harbour	Its the best Harbour in the world!

Sydney Harbour Bridge	take a walk across the bridge, or over the top for the fit	When in Sydney you must take a walk across the Sydney Harbour bridge , or over the top for the fit. The view is fantastic	Adventurous
Sydney Harbour Bridge	For God's sake don't drive across	Although thousands of cars and trains cross this historic coathanger bridge every day of the year, by far the best way to cross the Harbour Bridge is on foot or on a bike started circular quay cross to the northside, take a swim in the historic North Sydney pool would take the kids to the rides at Luna Park. Catch the ferry on the way home, or drop in Darling Harbour to some additional playtime and some great restaurants on the foreshore.	Adventurous
Sydney Harbour Bridge	Breath taking	If you want to view Sydney the do the Harbour Bridge climb. It looks much steeper then it really is. It is an easy climb for all ages. The guides were excellent and very informative. Highly recommend.	Adventurous
Sydney Harbour Bridge	Loved this	I took my 13 year old daughter to climb the bridge with her friend!!! We had the best time. The view is truly unforgettable. They prepare you really well. It isn't a hard climb at all. It is a gradual climb so as long as your not afraid of heights you will be fine. Standing in the middle of the bridge was amazing and climbing through it is really fascinating.	Adventurous
Sydney Harbour Bridge	What a view	To walk over this bridge is something really special, it's a once in a life time experience and the views from the top take your breath away and they will live with you forever, it's defiantly a must	Adventurous
Manly Sea Life Sanctuary - Shark Dive Xtreme	a great experience	Very profesional and relaxed experience. My 14 year old daughter did the dive with the sharks and hundreds of other fish and turtles and could not stop talking about it. Instructors were fun and informative. They walk around the bottom of the pool with all the creatures swimming by. You get to see them through the clear wall and roof. Manly a fun place also. We caught the ferry over and had lunch at one of the great Pubs in the corso.	Adventurous
Manly Sea Life Sanctuary - Shark Dive Xtreme	a great experience	Being a first time dive this was a challenging and thrilling experience. The equipment is top rate and the instructors know their stuff and clearly care for the animals under their care. My only criticism would be that quite a bit of time during the dive is spent taking photos and video of the dive which is fine if your interested in paying additional fees for this which I wasn't. Overall though highly recommended.	Adventurous
Manly Sea Life Sanctuary - Shark Dive Xtreme	Very glad we visited	Manly Sea life sanctuary is a lot smaller than Sydney Sealife, however I really enjoyed that about this aquarium. To start of it is located on the beach which was really beautiful, plus It is only a few minute walk from where you get off of the ferry. The tanks and set up of this place is beyond what I expected, they all clean and well presented. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting here and I liked the fact that it wasn't so busy that you could spend the time getting a good look at the aquariums and also talking to the friendly staff.	Fun
Manly Sea Life Sanctuary - Shark Dive Xtreme	Great, not just for thrill seakers	I went with my husband, and was one of the best experiences we have done. The sharks are not dangerous, great instructors that make you feel safe and you go in a small group. Highly recommended.	Adventurous
Manly Sea Life Sanctuary - Shark Dive Xtreme	The most wow experience ever!	Diving with sharks was an experience that i will treasure for all my life! To be able to be next to this creature...wow!! Also you get the opportunity to see huge turtles (one bumped on my head!), rays and other fishes. The instructor was very friendly and gave me good instructions about the diving. It was my first time using the diving equipment and it was not hard.	Adventurous
Royal Botanic Gardens	i'm not an outdoors guy, but this place is amazing	As the title suggests, I don't really go on outdoors-type activities but when I was in Sydney with my wife for our honeymoon we went here and it wound up being an incredible afternoon. I could go on and on about how pretty the vast varieties of trees and flowers were. I could also talk a lot about all of the different types of birds to see, and even how relaxing it is to sit by the lake or look at the spectacular views of Sydney while overlooking the harbor. But really, you just need to see it for yourself. We planned on only staying for about an hour, but after walking around a small potion of the park before we knew it we were there for more than 2 hours. My wife and I had to keep reminding ourselves that we were there "during the ugly time" because it was the end of winter when we visited, but it was still sooooo beautiful. Certainly a must see place if you spend any time in Sydney.	Natural

Sydney Opera House	A true landmark	Although we did not have time to see a show here, we toured the Opera House and took lots of pictures. The evening pictures are extraordinary. This venue does not disappoint! I would recommend having dinner in the outdoor cafe at the base of the Opera House. It was great. You can see both the "Coathanger" and the Opera House.	Hungry

Manly Scenic Walkway	Do something unusual why you're in Sydney	it is a great idea to spend a day on the clifftops and coastlines extending along Sydney's northern beaches. Catch a ferry from circular quay to Manly, then walk the coastal walk along the clifftops from Manly to the spit Bridge. This distance is approximately 7 to 8 km it is an easy walk with a clearly marked path. There are several small cafes and villages along the way we can grab a snack or a quick coffee.although he can walk the remainder of the distance back to circular quay, probably better option is to take the bus. This total day will take you approximately 6 to 7 hours including a delicious lunch in either Manly or at the Spit Bridge.	Natural

Manly Scenic Walkway	Great walk	You walk through a couple of different terrains, and you can join, or exit the walkway at any point depending on your fitness or physical abilities.

Take the time to walk down to Camp Cove, a beautiful little harbour beach. Walk around the Heritage Track around South Head, past Lady Bay (nude) beach for a fabulous view out to sea, across to North and Middle Heads and look back to iconic views of the city. There is a lovely little red and white striped light house and historic light house keeper's cottage on the way.You can walk along the cliffs to Bondi (takes about an hour from here), or walk back towards the city through the streets of Vaucluse via gorgeous Parsley Bay. Try to avoid Sundays (lots of people around the wharf and the Gap) and sunny winter days are even better!	Natural

Art Gallery of NSW	Great space	combining both the modern and the old, this gallery is a most relaxing space to wander through. We actually had a guide show us through the modern art sections and she was so knowledgeable and interesting. Recommend highly. We wandered through the whole gallery ourselves after the tour and explored seeing some brilliant artwork. There are also some lovely views out over the harbour from the generous seating areas also. Dont miss it.	Cultural
Art Gallery of NSW	Lovely Aboriginal Art	We visited the art gallery with my family(2kids) and we really enjoyed our visit. The kids usually get bored looking at art, but they loved the Aboriginal art section. The gallery is much bigger than it looks and there's lots to look at. The cafe at the gallery is a bit expensive, and not very special, so it's better to get lunch somewhere else, other than that everything is great. We went on Thursday, but found out that it's open late on wednesdays. So if you want to go there in the evening make sure you go on Wednesday, it closes at 10pm.	Cultural
Art Gallery of NSW	Great way to spend an afternoon	Free and full of culture. Worth the visit and it is located in beautiful gardens. They also have a yummy coffee shop.	Cultural

This is a "must" stop for us on every visit.	Cultural

Manly Beach	Don't visit Sydney without seeing Manly	Manly is the jewel in the crown that is Sydney. Never fails to please no matter what the weather. So many great little restaurants and coffee shops and the standard is very high. Great spot for an ice cream or fish and chips on the promenade. If you like a walk, there are some great sight to be seen walking around Manly and surrounds. Catch the ferry either from or to Circular Quay and you will be delighted by the views. Manly is an eternal favourite for locals and visitors alike. Spend the day and you wont be disappointed. Spend a week and you will fall in love with the place.	Hungry

There are Sunday markets with lots of cool things to buy.	Hungry

Other attractions include the Harbourside shopping centre and the Aquarium.It's worth a visit however I would only reccommend you go for a meal as the restaurants here really are great, and there are fireworks every Saturday at 9pm.	Social
Darling Harbour	Must-visit	Darling Harbour is attractive during day and romantic and fun during evening time. There are many attractions like aquarium, zoo, and IMAX with the world's biggest screen which I was very impressed by. On the left hand side (close to George St.) you will see alot of bars, pubs and cafes also!	Fun
Darling Harbour	Something for everyone	Good range of restaurants and Bars and continually refreshed. A Sydney city playground. The district is about to undergo an upgrade of access and exhibition facilities.	Hungry
Sydney Lyric Theatre	Strictly Ballroom - What a great musical!	Saw the show a few days ago. Went without any expectations as I have not heard of this musical before but it was simply fantastic! Good music, great dancing and lavish costumes. Thoroughly enjoyed myself. I strongly recommend this show and would go again if there is a chance to do so I had tickets on Row H, towards the side and had close up views of the whole stage. Theatre is small but seats are spacious. There is a food court right next to theatre with choice of different types of food - not cheap but was tasty.	Cultural

Sydney Lyric Theatre	What a show	Such a good show, it's very well put together from the story of the film I remember from years ago. From the moment you go into the theatre you are met with the seats and auditorium that are decorated into theme. The happy party feeling of the show seemed to rub off on all the viewers. The show itself was full of great performances, wonderful singing and costumes. We all really enjoyed and so glad to have taken it in while in Sydney.	Cultural

Spit Bridge to Manly Walk	Highly recommend	This is a fabulous walk, I loved every minute of it and the scenery is amazing.I caught the ferry into Manly and visited the Hello Manly visitor centre to get some information and the girls there suggested that I do the Manly to Spit or Spit to Manly walk.I caught the bus to Spit bridge (so I could end the walk in Manly) and began the walk. I swam at little beaches along the way and had an amazing time...the people on the walk were so friendly.Love love love	Fun
Spit Bridge to Manly Walk	Spectacular Views	The harbour is accessible to all and nowhere is it more so than on this walk. Pass the boats moored at the spit, stroll through suburbia and then through light bush until you're looking out across the heads. Its even more spectacular when the weather changes - if you're brave! Don't forget your camera.	Adventurous
Spit Bridge to Manly Walk	A pleasant walk with good harbour views	If you enjoy bush walking, the Spit to Manly walk is a good option when in the Sydney area and affords excellent views of the Harbour, City, and Manly. It follows the coast line from the Spit Bridge through bushland, and round a number of bays and inlets. Around 2 hours (assuming you aren't stopping too frequently). If travelling from the the city, a bus to the Spit, and the ferry back from Manly is what I'd recommend.	Adventurous
Spit Bridge to Manly Walk	Worth the effort	We started at the Spit bridge and walked to Manly. Fantastic views of the natural beauty of the harbour, especially the Manly side. A long walk, with many steps, some quite steep. Some stepped areas currently under upgrade. The walk is teasing, as although Manly ferry area is in sight, the path goes well away as it follows the bay. It took us about 3 hours,as an older couple,but if you want to stop and look at all the side paths on the way, allow much longer. Make sure you walk it with enough light to finish, and when cooler but not wet, as it could be difficult on some of the steeply stepped areas. Manly is a great place to visit, with lots of places to eat after the effort.	Adventurous
Spit Bridge to Manly Walk	Beautiful escape from town	My friend and I enjoyed this little hike, lots of uphill and downhill but you can take it at your own pace. Beautiful views across Manly. Made me feel like I was on holiday - which I was	Adventurous

Queen Victoria Building	the beauty in Sydney	To think they were going to knock it down! It is one of the greatest late nineteenth-century buildings left in Aus and has been beautifully restored. A collection of who's who in fashion retail outlets. Don't miss a breakfast in the cafe on the ground floor. There's a reason it's normally busy.	Historical
Queen Victoria Building	Great shopping	Amazing looking 4 story shopping mall located in close proximity to everything. The architecture of the building is amazing. Heaps of shops including Victorias secret and Zumbo macaroons. The bottom floor is very busy especially is peak hour times, the bottom floor is connected to the City rail lines. Best shopping and a must do when in Sydney.	Cultural
Palm Beach	Paradise	There is no better place a clear Summers day. The walk to Barrenjoey Lighthouse is an added attraction followed by a lovely lunch at the golfclub. Ideal Sunday activity, just be early so you can park!!	Adventurous
Palm Beach	Clean and beautiful beach	Palm Beach is an approximate 2.5 hours drive from the Sydney city centre. The beach stretches on for quite a distance and we loved that it wasn't crowded like other beaches. We walked from Palm Beach to the Barrenjoey Lighthouse, which wasn't an easy walk in the soft sand when your feet sinks in and sets you back by half a step! But that's how soft the sand is! The view at the top of the Barrenjoey climb was very rewarding and breathtaking, a panorama of the Broken Bay and Palm Beach. Easily one of the most beautiful beaches I've been to.	Adventurous
Palm Beach	Not far away but a different world	I live in Manly and I love it to travel to Palm Beach with friends just for a relaxed beach day with a nice barbecue on the evening. The drive is not so bad but the beach is really nice and not so crowded like other beaches along the coast from Sydney. Always worth the drive.	Lazy
Palm Beach	Beautiful	I can honestly say I have never seen a beach so clean with sand so soft. It was a pleasure to view and walk along it. Whoever maintains this should be very proud. No visitors should be disappointed with the scenery...absolutely beautiful	Natural
Palm Beach	Relax	An amazing and beautiful place. Just love it. I wanna go back there again. A good place to get in touch with nature	Natural
Cronulla Beach	Great walk while you soak in the atmosphere	Beautiful walk at your own pace. Follow the ocean from beach to beach. I sometimes take my little dog who seems to love the walk as much as I do. Break the walk ...enjoy a coffee...breathe in the fresh air...great place for photos.	Adventurous
Cronulla Beach	Great views but beware on weekends	I did this walk on a Saturday and the beginning of the walk was packed with people walking, jogging and cycling. Some joggers and cyclists are a bit pushy and some locals stop along the pathway to talk to friends - they block the pathway all together. After walking about 3 km the amount of people dropped off and I really enjoyed the walk. The weather was great, the views are great and there are water bubblers on the way to quench your thirst. It would probably be better to do it during the week when there are less people on the path.	Adventurous
Cronulla Beach	Easy walk in both directions	Easy walk in both directions. Pavement great for pedestrians, prams and wheelchairs. 1) Head south (about twenty steps) or for the disabled or elderly or prams follow the path behind the Surf club - for a gentle incline. Continue past "the point" see the board riders, past small secluded beaches, past "Shelly beach" free ocean swimming pool, past "Oak park" free ocean swimming pool, and end at "Matthew Flinders Point" - overlooking the river- with views to Bundeena. or 2) Head North, very level, around the bay from "Cronulla" beach, past two free ocean swimming pools, past "North Cronulla" beach, past "Elouera" beach, past "Wanda" beach. Here the pavement ends but you can continue on the beach past "Green Hills" and further for longer walk - if you have time. Walk from 10 minutes to 2 to 3 hours if you want. Note: No bikes and no roller skates on pavement. Come and take a walk here. Well worth the look.	Adventurous
Cronulla Beach	So nice and quiet	Cronulla Beach is a Sydney suburb, it has a great Esplanade, well maintained, with many parks and recreation areas along it, you can make pic nics, barbies or just go for a pleasant walk, you can also find natural salt water swimming pools all along, surfing is great, the boulevard offers supermarkets, butchery, breads, caffees, stores, gym, yoga studios, book stores, ice cream parlors, frozen yogurts, all kinds of restaurants, cinema... you name it!, you can get there by train or bus if you don't have a car. People are really friendly, at the very end of the Esplanade close to Wanda you can explore further more till you get to a gorgeous dune... Don't miss it	Natural

Government House	Well worth a visit	The tour of this icon building is well worth it. The information of Sydney and Governor and her duties was amazing. Don't miss it, you won't be disappointed	Cultural
Government House	Free tour	This was a pleasant surprise of a tour. Run by volunteers they take you through the official residence of the Governor. Lots of history in the building and the guide was very interactive with our group and tried to be as inclusive as possible as many of us were non Australians. No pictures inside, but the grounds are nice to tour through afterwards.	Cultural
Government House	free, informative and relaxed	This tour lasts 45 mins and runs every hour from 10.30am on Thursday to Sunday unless there is a private function (check before you go). Our guide was a little self important but was very knowledgeable and spoke well. We were a group of about10 of mixed nationalities which made it even better.The condition of the building, decor and furniture was perfection as you would expect in a buiding used on a daily basis by theQueen's representative in NSW.The gardens also deserve an honourable mention.	Education
Government House	Nice little building	This was a nice little stop. Relaxed under some trees and looked out at the harbour to kill a little time. Nice relaxing few hours in sydney here	Lazy
Government House	Great free history lesson	I have been in Australian for eight years and probably learned more in the free tour at Government House about early Australian history and culture than in all my school years and natural curiosity combined! The house and its grounds are beautiful and quite unique to Australia. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and able to answer all of the questions our tour had.	Education

Circular Quay	Must feel spot	People, river, vessels, vehicles, ... Everyone, everything is alive. Once U were in Sydney, u can't miss it. I will go back there in a couple of days. Yes i am going to taking a cruise ship, because here i am in Sydney and want to feel the air of Sydney harbor itself.	Social
Circular Quay	Heart of Sydney	Great scenery to walk around the harbour, heaps of restaurants in the lead up to walking around to the opera house. Circular Quay is the main port for all the cruise ships and ferries. Short distance from the city and easily accessible by the efficient train service.	Hungry
Australian National Maritime Museum	The sub is worth the visit	This place is really cool. I am not a fan of maritime museum but it is very well done and the visit of the sub at the end is definitely worth the price paid I would definitely recommend having a look around if you have a couple of hours to spare	Historical
Australian National Maritime Museum	Brilliant  	We thoroughly enjoyed our day here, but the highlight was the submarine. The youngest kids loved the replica Endeavour too, but I found downstairs too claustrophobic so exited that part of the tour as quickly as possible. We would definitely visit again next trip to Sydney. Fantastic photographs.	Historical
Australian National Maritime Museum	Interesting  	Despite visiting Sydney many times over the years, we had never been to the Maritime Museum. I found it more interesting, informative & historic than I would have thought. We had guided tours given by volunteers of a submarine & other ships, including a working replica of Captain Cook’s Endeavour.Thankfully, I had worn pants instead of a skirt & flat shoes on the day as we had to clamber up several steep ladders. Also, large bags or backpacks would be a hindrance due to the cramped areas & corridors & protruding ‘bits’ but there are storage lockers provided at the Museum entrance.I suggest doing the outside vessels first before the museum as it works out better time-wise & I think the ships may close off before the museum. There are heaps of exhibits & information inside the museum about the personal journeys of immigrants, world wars, aboriginal & Torres Strait islanders, Australian Navy & all things nautical.I would think that children would also enjoy the visit, although perhaps not the ships for the littlies.	Education
Australian National Maritime Museum	Pleasant surprise	We had not planned to do the Maritime and did so only at the instance of our four year old who had spied the battle ship and wanted to tour it. The museum is amazing! You can tour multiple ships including the jaw-dropping replica of Captain Cook's ship. We were there over school holiday and there was a 'circus' going on that turned out to be very well put on, a ton of laughs and a lot of educational content slipped in that has stuck with the kids.	Historical
Australian National Maritime Museum	Fun  	Kids had a blast watching the live show, climbing the boats and submarine. Recommend this for school holiday activity.	Social
Newtown	Great for vegos/vegans and restaurants	a very eclectic crowd - newtown is abundant in restaurants and bars. There is also a great vintage clothing scene and little kitschy shops.	Hungry
Newtown	LOVE!!!!	Love this area. Stayed here during my first trip to Syd. Most my days were taken by work commitments. This area was great to walk around in the evening. So many great cafes and places to eat. Fantastic clothes shops also. I would definitely stay in Newtown whenever I visit Sydney again. And only couple train stops from the city	Hungry
Newtown	Dining	Was in Newtown, Sydney recently and dined at Yenikoy Cafe & Restaurant. Food and service absolutely great. I highly recommend a visit.	Hungry
Newtown	See a different side to Sydney	Head to Newtown and enjoy the Thai food, shopping, coffee, bars and people watching! Student, bohemian, trendy crowd.	Hungry
Newtown	Eclectic smorgasboard of shops, bars, pubs & eateries	From Vintage furniture and clothing to obscure curio shops, Newtown was a revelation to me after living in Neutral Bay! I finally found what I was looking for. A buzzy eclectic mix of independent shops, bars, pubs and a crazy mix of international cuisine. Not to be missed as part of the whole Sydney experience.	Social
St. Mary's Cathedral	Exquisite!	It's such a large cathedral, yet inside is just exquisite. It's so tranquil amidst the hustle and bustle of the city! The architecture is just breath-taking, very sacred. I would recommend to drop-in if you have the time and are in the area.	Cultural
St. Mary's Cathedral	Peaceful	City is always buzzing with so much people and aactivities that one would think that there is no place for peace and quiet. Come to St. Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. Externally you are awed with its magnificent Architectures, which is mostly of Gothic arts. As you see the church building from each base then looking upward to the highest point of the tower and spires one is somehow engaged into prayer and connected to the power that beyond human can emagine. Just that feeling of awe and wonder that will lead oneself to discover for more thus your feet is leading you to go inside the church maybe because of curiosity or appreciation of arts or maybe one feels the urge to pray in silence. Wither ways, being in the the church one would feel the presence of holiness and peacefulness of the holy ground. Thus to sit or kneel in prayer being in touched with your being and with God. The inside of the church is surounded with the stained glasses that will tell you about your faith and also the history of the church in Australia. The domes and the architectures of the church is blending so much to your hearts longing to be connected to God. The church is a place of quiet and solace for everyone other that art appreciation ... Plus if you happen to be in the church worship then most likely you hear the singing of boys' choir voices like angels and the men's choir whose voices as so solid and precise. The singing of the choir will uplift your heart and put you more to prayer.	Lazy
St. Mary's Cathedral	A few moments of Peace!	St Mary's is an oasis in the heart of a crazy city. The old sandstone arcchitecture creates the most wonder acoustics so if there is a performance of sacred musicthen that would be a absolute must do!	Luxurious
St. Mary's Cathedral	St Mary's Cathedral	This church is absolutely stunning and well worth the visit, The architecture of the building is just beautiful and the history that comes with the church is worth following up.	Cultural
St. Mary's Cathedral	Worth stopping by	Beautifil architecture, lovingly cared for inside and out. Stained glass windows are amazing. Great place for quiet reflection.	Cultural
Bondi Beach	great atmosphere	Was expecting bondi to feel overrated but there was a great atmopshere when I did the walk between bondi and bronte. The sand is super fine, and plenty of surfers to keep you entertained! I did visit in august so it wasnt very busy but I would recommend a visit.	Social
Bondi Beach	see sea and surf	Fine, white sand beach... vast parking space... one of the popular beaches among all other fantastic, must-visit waters in Sydney. Perfect place to walk or jog and move from Bondi to another beach in a 1-hr stroll. Vast seashore seems to never get crowded even when plenty locales and tourists flock the area during ordinary days.	Adventurous
Bondi Beach	Must see  	Everyone is talking about it, lots of stories told. I think its worth the trip. its a long stretch of sandy beach, followed by some grass to hang out and restaurants across the street. The sand beach is rather wide and full of surfers during summer. We ate at the famous Hurrican Ribs BBQ restaurant which was really tasty, reservation required... Theres a beach restaurant, which is ok for a drink or sandwich, a bit pricey though. You can find plenty of surfers gear shop, souvenir shops and many more. From Sydney city center it takes you arond 20-30 minutes by bus.	Lazy
Bondi Beach	Very beautiful	Bondi Beach is very beautiful. We visited in August so it was a bit cold, but we actually went for a swim and it was great! Locals say they go swimming all year long, so we decided to give it a go as well. It's a great family location, very friendly and relaxing. Many nice cafes around the beach, so lot'f of food to chose from. Definitely worth going there if ever in Sydney! If you do go there, make sure you walk all the way around it, because there are some nice views from the rocks, we took great photographs.	Lazy
Bondi Beach	Beautiful	I loved this place, it was winter, cold and wet but I loved it. the surfers, the sand and the waves were amazing. I would not miss it if in Sydney again	Natural
State Library of NSW	A life interrupted exhibition	Apart from the grandeur and splendour of the library itself, this exhibition of WW1 using diary excerpts is hauntingly memorable and well worth going to see. From the minutiae of every day conversations, to the horrors experienced, all from the large collection of diaries, it is a fascinating and poignant reminder of interrupted lives. The copies if the newspapers are great to read including the adverts, they lighten the mood. If you have a spare hour, this exhibition is most certainly worthwhile.	Historical
State Library of NSW	Great free exhibitions & an historic library building...	The State Library is one of my favourite haunts when I need an art fix; holding numerous and varied temporary art exhibitions. The space is inviting and open; and it's compact size means I never feel overwhelmed. Perhaps most appealing is that I don't recall ever having to pay to view any of the exhibitions; meaning it's accessible to everyone and gives everyone the chance to experience art. If you're interested in architecture - the Mitchell Library building next door to the newer space is stunning with high vaulted ceilings, marble staircases and soaring sandstone columns. Check online for current and upcoming exhibitions & put the Library on your to-do list!	Cultural
State Library of NSW	Unexpected find	If you stuck for things to do indoors, this is a great place to spend a few hours as the library is nothing like the one I have ever been to. It has a free gallery upstairs with interesting history and art exhibition. During our visit, I really like the Kings Cross photographic exhibition which they have an app to guide you through the exhibits. The building is huge, plenty of places to sit and they also have a cafe indoors and free wifi throughout the building. Highly recommended.	Historical
State Library of NSW	A hidden delight	The inside of this building is really stunning, well worth visiting just to see the main reading room. They have interesting exhibits in the Mitchell wing of the library, on the top floor. All sorts of items on display, including some paintings of Sydney, a convict cap and ticket of leave, down to an illuminated manuscript and a seal of King Henry IV. Free admission.	Cultural
State Library of NSW	Like this	Steeped in history and with an ever changing gallery, the library is a great place to go to experience some local flavor. The map on the floor of the entry way is a glimpse into the past and the ways that map-making has advanced in the last two centuries. The main library room is absolutely breath taking, especially if you actually manage to make it inside. This is definitely a must see if you're trying to experience Sydney's history. For the great price of free, this is an excellent place to do research, read up to date periodicals or even to rest your feet after the daily grind. This library has everything you'd need to get your work or school research done!	Historical
Hyde Park	Beautiful library	This is a classic old school state library with a sweeping staircase, lots of old timber and old world charm. I was there for a meeting so only got to wander in briefly, but it looked beautiful and I noted a number of interesting exhibitions as well - all free entry. Friendly, helpful staff and a cafe below that seemed pretty popular. I'd like to get back to check it out when I'm not working.	Historical
Hyde Park	Not just a library	Decided to take the free guided tour out of curiosity. Libraries are usually quiet places this bucks the trend it encourages technology and has a floor dedicated to the use of laptops with free wi- fi and plenty of power outlets. The library consists of two parts old and new. The marble in the old section is all Australian and the wood carving intricate. The guide was extremely knowledgeable, enthusiastic and proud of this lovely building and all the treasures it holds. Also has exhibitions which are changed on a regular basis. Worth a visit.	Historical
Hyde Park	Must do for locals and tourists alike	Visited with kids (9-11 yo). This place is fantastic ! Free quided tours daily at 10.30 am, which was most informative and visually impressive. Great collection of books, rich history , wonderful overall atmosphere. The tour was great for adults , a little too complex for younger kids. There are computers with free wifi at the coffee shop. The current exhibition on Sydney's homeless in the foyer,so beautifully done!	Historical
Hyde Park	Wander at will and its free	This place deserves a look. On offer... Peace and quiet, welcoming staff, archival items on display in the Mitchell wing, in our case some wonderful pieces from The First Fleet and English settlement, an informative video detailing the hows and whys of collecting and what's done to preserve items, books galore, a lovely interior and a slice of Australian history.	Historical
Hyde Park	We were very pleasantly surprised	We only stopped in because we were walking by and we were very glad we did. The facilities are very impressive. There is a guided tour of the building daily at 10:30. They currently have an exhibition called "the greatest wonder of the world" about the gold rush and the miners, which included many old photos and they had a guided tour of the exhibit. Unfortunately, it will be closing soon. The guide and the people were very friendly.	Historical
The Strand Arcade	Go there for the architecture, not the shops!	I have to say that I love this little historical arcade. There are so few really old buildings left in Sydney, and this is a little ge. I have to say, however that I would never waste my time even looking in the shops there, they're overpriced and very ordinary. So, if you're in the city & would like to see a very cute & detailed old arcade, then go for sure. But if you're shopping, there are so many better places to go. If you really want to appreciate the architecture then take one of the cute little old lifts up for a better view of the interior of the building (and you can wonder at how expensive the shops are for the very ordinary products they offer whilst you're there), then walk down one of the old stair wells and appreciate the old, original tiling.	Historical
The Strand Arcade	Step back in time to 1981	I recently took a trip down memory as I walked through Sydney. On a whim I decided to visit the Strand Arcade which I hadn't visited in years. I had forgotten the beautiful architecture and variety of shops and cafes. Great atmosphere and great for window shopping. Step back in time to 1891 and experience old world charm in Sydney.	Historical
The Strand Arcade	Fashion central	Lovely old arcade beautifully restored. Great for fashion, but especially for jewels! Rox on the ground floor has innovative, interesting pieces, but do make sure you go to the top floor and leave lots of browsing time. Zappacosta does great coloured stones in lots of designs and will modify to your taste. There's also some great opal designs in some of the ground floor shops, a nice contrast to the rather dull tourist standards. Great for an big Italian lunch too, or a coffee hit.	Luxurious
The Strand Arcade	Gorgeous Example of Victorian Architecture	The Strand Arcade is almost 115 years old and still remains in its original form despite becoming run down and needing restoration work in the 1970s. it even survived a fire. Many designer labels have shops here, so you need deep pockets and likely to be out of reach of the majority. However the window displays fit in with the general luxurious ambiance of the entire building. Quite a decadent experience	Historical
The Strand Arcade	Elegant old building 	The best thing about this arcade is the actual building itself - it has such a timeless feel to it. This arcade is conveniently located off George St and onto Pitt St Mall. I've never actually bought anything here, but it is a lovely place to walk through and browse.	Historical
Madame Tussuads Sydney	Great day out for kids 	Figures are very real and life like, you expect them to actually move. Great for kids as it is very interactive, children can dress up and are allowed on props for photos etc. Lots of information regarding each person, a little overpriced though.	Fun
Madame Tussuads Sydney	Fun attraction	With 3 boys in tow, this was sooooo much fun. Really loved our visit. The boys got were playfully dramatic and surprised me with their enthusiasm to dress up and role play. Enjoyed this immensely.	Fun
Madame Tussuads Sydney	Best place to meet all your favourite celebrity	This is the place to go to,to meet all your favorite celebrities and people who have made outstanding contributions to the world. Loved getting pictures with the celebrities. It f you can try and avoid the weekend. It gets too crowded may be because its very popular. If they do not have someone you wanted to see you can tell them on a survey that you can fill it electronically before exiting. Overall had a fun time and the kids loved it.	Fun
Madame Tussuads Sydney	Great Experience	This is the first time that I visit and it was fun and interesting. A lot of famous celebrity statues and it was great to take a lot of funny photos. It a must to visit this attraction if you are in Sydney. It nearby to Darling Harbour and you can don't forget to bring along your camera.	Fun
Madame Tussuads Sydney	Hilarious fun	I went here with my teenage daughter. I booked online which was a reasonable price. We had such a great time! We took loads of photos with the models - so glad that u can get so close to them. They are amazingly life like. Be prepared to get involved - put on the costumes, get into it and get some funny photos.	Fun
IMAX Theatre Sydney	Huge screen	It's the world's biggest movie screen, what's more to say? Prices are not on the cheap side, but are well worth the experience. Amazing picture and even greater sound makes for a unique 3D experience. On top of that, there's a wide selection of bars and restaurants all around Darling Harbour.	Luxurious
IMAX Theatre Sydney	Great fun	Loved the IMAX film so much booked another straight away! Absolutely wonderful and great fun! An absolute must - children would love it! Staff helpful and efficient - theater spacious and open. An all round brilliant afternoon - and a fabulous setting when you come out, surrounded by wonderful restaurants!	Fun
IMAX Theatre Sydney	Fantastic Experience - World Largest' Screen	A little bit more pricey than the normal cinema but where else are you going to get the chance to experience the worlds largest cinema screen - and what an experience it was - just make sure you choose a decent film!! They give you the best seats available, we only watched a normal film but im sure one of the 3D films would be even better! Screenings are limited though so make sure you research times and films in advance!	Luxurious
IMAX Theatre Sydney	Worth the money	Cost a lot of money but the screen is the biggest in the world and really is the best cinema I've ever experienced. I saw gravity and it appeared incredibly realistic. Well worth the money	Luxurious
IMAX Theatre Sydney	Great 3D!	Very cool. Big cinema screen and awesome fun. The Imax theatre is located at Darling Harbor which is a great place to hangout. The tickets are a bit expensive but in return you get a quality entertainment (On your birthday, you can get a free ticket, save you about 30 dollars). Even if you are not really into watching movies at the cinema it is worth to know the biggest Imax theatre in the world. Besides, the popcorn is very good.	Fun
Observatory Hill	A beautiful place to watch sunset 	It's a really peaceful park with lovely views across the water to the Harbour Bridge and over to North Sydney (including Luna Park). A favourite spot for wedding photos on a Saturday afternoon. Really stunning at sunset.	Lazy
Observatory Hill	Wonderful views of the city plus a cafe and gallery	Our local friends took us up here for a look at the gorgeous city of Sydney. We didn't visit the Observatory, but the cafe next to the art gallery was very nice. Not cheap, but delicious food in a pleasant setting. A wedding had been held on the grounds an hour before, and you could understand why. Lovely trees and benches here and all over the city.	Lazy
Observatory Hill	Bring a picnic!	This place is easy to walk to if you're staying in the city. The views of the harbour and the Bridge offer a different perspective and are great for photos. Bring a picnic and a rug. Sit and relax!	Lazy
Observatory Hill	Wedded Bliss	It is a lovely site for a wedding and has great views of the bridge, the harbour and around Sydney. Lovely on a fine day.	Lazy
Observatory Hill	Spectacular; historic	You get a feeling of what it may have been like for the first settlement to be looking out from here for a boat with supplies to come into view but better information on the history of the place would make it a better experience, the local area during the day has amazing views.	Historical
Sydney Tower EYE	Well worth it!	The views from the top are well worth any apprehension at walking so high above the city. The staff were great and helped quell our older boy's initial fear. The overalls were particularly attractive!! Definitely worth the money and any trepidation.	Adventurous
Sydney Tower EYE	Worth the extra money	Good experience, worth the upgrade. Even if you are a bit iffy about heights you should like it. You are secured at all times so it is quite safe.	Adventurous
Sydney Tower EYE	Fantastic experience  	Visited the Sydney Tower Eye 2 years ago now and had a buffet lunch in the rotating restaurant. Food was fantastic, beautiful views and overall a brilliant experience!	Hungry
Sydney Tower EYE	Great views	We went up the tower just before sunset. So we were able to see the city whilst still light, and as it darkened. It's absolutely stunning at night time. Definitely the best time to go to get maximum beauty of the city.	Fun
Sydney Tower EYE	Exhilarating and breathtaking 	The Sydney Tower Eye Tour was awesome. We started by strolling around the Observation Deck taking you through a panoramic view of Sydney and learning about the city through the multilingual interactive touchscreens. We did the Skywalk which was awesome because it took us to more than 260metres above ground, looking directly down the city streets through a platform with a glass floor. We felt very secure though because we were suited up and harnessed throughout the tour. What an adventure! Then we watched the 4D cinema show which was so cool, I hear it's a first of a few in Australia. This sight and your is something you shouldn't miss when in Sydney.	Adventurous
Customs House	Grand building worth venturing into	Customs House is one of the city`s oldest and loveliest buildings with a great open square in front of it where you can indulge in a drink or coffee, or even a meal and watch the passing parade, especially as it is located right at Circular Quay (a very busy transport area for buses, trains and, of course, ferries. Inside the building is equally impressive and it has an interesting model display of Sydney under glass of the ground floor. There are lovely sitting areas for reading or for using free WI-Fi, as one the city`s main libraries is located within the building. There are often interesting, free exhibitions. On the rooftop there is an a la carte restaurant Cafe Sydney (yet to eat here) with stunning views of the harbour.	Lazy
Customs House	A gem	Discovered the place by accident. It's not well signposted as a place to visit but the building itself draws you to it. Loved all the information provided within.	Education
Customs House	A lovely building and a glimpse into history	The massive Customs House is a real insight into Australia’s history. A magnificent and impressive building, the location is perfect, being right behind Circular Quay. There is a great open courtyard out the front, and the building has lovely columns and decorations. The stonework is magnificent. Customs House is open for business, so you can take a look inside. A perfect, and somewhat quieter attraction, to combine with Circular Quay. Excellent.	Historical
Customs House	One of Sydney's grand old buildings	A beautiful grand old building at the entrance to Sydney. Great sense of Sydney's past and you can be thankful that Sydney isn't only a collection of modern glass towers. It is more than a building though - great sunken map and the collection of the world's newspapers is a highlight by itself.	Historical
Customs House	Customs House	Can't remember too much about my visit there but it is a part of Sydney's culture and is visited quite frequently.	Cultural
Powerhouse Museum	Wonderful museum with lots to see and do	The PowerHouse Museum is Australia's premiere scientific, technological and industrial design museum conveniently located in Ultimo, nearby to Darling Harbour. The museum has a great collection of early technology from Steam Engines right through to modern displays on environmental sustainability and Space. My kids really enjoyed the great array of experiments where they were able to learn about everything from conduction of energy, through to how to make fireworks and the use of nuclear medicine. A must for anyone visiting Sydney that is very reasonably priced.	Education
Powerhouse Museum	Powerhouse Museum Sydney	I have visited the powerhouse museum on several occasions and loved it. Have taken the grandchildren and spent hours there. It is such an educational place with lots of both old and new inventions and hands on experiences. Being an older person, it takes you back to things of the past like radio, television how we used to travel, clothes, even food. It is a must see museum. Loved it.	Education
Powerhouse Museum	Fun and engaging	Though it is primarily a science museum, it has a good Australia-centric leaning for tourists who want to enjoy science but also have a cultural experience. On our visit, we learned about The Beatles' Australia tour (not science-y but very culturally interesting), solar power in Australia, Australian engineering innovations, and multiple different musical instruments. We also got to draw designed clothes at a coloring station and play with various types of light shows and games in their lights exhibit.	Education
Powerhouse Museum	Power to the museum	You can learn so much at this museum - it's modern and historical and has excellent exhibitions. Saw Diana's dresses here last time we visited.	Education
Powerhouse Museum	Something for everyone	It is so easy to enjoy a museum when it is a bit hands on. This museum has some very interesting permanent exhibitions and regular has special exhibitions that add interest and fun.	Fun
Sydney Observatory	Southern Sky	Always great view, day and night. (of course the weather should be good..) I experienced night tour and luckly I could see the sky with the telescope! It was a little bit cloudy but it was okay to see the sky. It was a greate experience since I live on northern hemisphere and probably it's gonna be hard to see southern sky again. Worth 18 bucks! Great view, interesting 3D movies and explanation, enthusiastic tour guests.	Education
Sydney Observatory	A brilliant night	Did the night star star gazing tour with my girlfriend and we had a great night! The tour guide was fantastic, very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I'm not big into star gazing and this was a great introduction and brilliant value. The 3d mini film was great, and the observatory telescope was really interesting, I would 100% recommend this, great value, something different and a chilled out night!	Education
Sydney Observatory	Love history	I loved the historical archive of this science that the museum displays. gives one a look back in time and a measuring stick by which we can see how far we have come.	Historical
Sydney Observatory	Astronomical night out	The night tour was both informative and interesting, seeing Saturn, Alpha Centori and the moon close up. We were lucky to have Geoff, who was a natural orator and full of interesting facts. The 3D show at the end capped off an astronomical night out with the family. Highly recommend this to anyone who's wanted to spend a night out wanting to stimulate rather than kill a few brain cells.	Education
Sydney Observatory	This was magical	Everything you ever wanted to know about telescopes and the transit of Venus. And probably more. Really cool experience!!	Education
Sea Life Sydney Aquarium	Amazing	This was a FANTASTIC place to visit! So much work and detail has been put into the displays. It's easy to navigate your way through. And the actual sea life is beautiful, unique and so interesting. The shark tunnel in particular was fabulous! I brought my 15 month old and she had a ball! I've heard it can be busy, but on a Fri morning (work day) it was fine.	Fun
Sea Life Sydney Aquarium	Amazing Discovery	Located in the heart of Sydney at Darling Harbour. The breathtaking and the highlight of the experience is walking through the glass tunnels, and you'll encounter some of the world's most incredible animals unique to each habitat. Including two of only five DUGONGS on display anywhere in the world. You will see sharks, massive stingrays, and thousands of tropical fish. This public aquarium, houses the worlds largest collection of all Australian aquatic life, in a unique freshwater and marine aquatic environment.

Sydney has a lot to offer, that no where else around the world has.	Fun
Sea Life Sydney Aquarium	Great Visit	Really enjoyed our visit to the aquarium, the tunnel was amazing and the sea life is impressive. Had a great time.	Fun
Sea Life Sydney Aquarium	Best aquarium i have been to	I love that the best aquarium is in my home city. The aquarium boasts sea life from all around the world but also entails that of Australia's. I have seen some decent aquariums in Australia and USA but this still ranks as the best. Go check it out with the family.	Fun
Sea Life Sydney Aquarium	One to see	Sydney Aquarium is a must see attraction for Sydney residents and visitors. I have been there few times and every time the displays and exhibits have improved. Ability to see the sharks, stingrays, sea horses adn Dugong at one place	Fun
Cockle Bay Wharf	Has it all	Many shops and restaurants in this area, part of the Darling Harbour experience it has almost everything you could possible need. There is a Ferry service to Circular Quay, close to the light rail and buses. Easy walking to the Fish Markets, Star City and Central CBD. Plenty of ambience nice to sit with a coffee or drink and watch the world go by.	Lazy
Cockle Bay Wharf	So many restaurants and bars to choose from	So many restaurant and bars to choose from. Not to mention, there's a movie theater and a shopping area along the boardwalk, and The Star casino is walking distance. It's a great place to meet up with friends, take someone out on a date, or even take an out-of-towner.	Social
Cockle Bay Wharf	Just delightful	Take a breath from the busy schedule and take a trip here and enjoy the scenery. The restaurants and bars are great and also take part in the 'happy hour' so no worries.	Social
Cockle Bay Wharf	If it's food, music, fun you want, this is the place	Ablaze with lights, sound and activity. This place is busy and noisy on Friday & Saturday nights.

A truly beautiful place at night filled with beautiful people.	Social
Cockle Bay Wharf	Great location	Brillant, great location, Lots of resturants, Bars, More bars, Food, walking, more bars	Social
Australian Museum	Good introduction to the country	This museum offers a good insight into the natural world of Australia. We spent 2 or 3 hours wondering and reading. There is a room devoted to Aborignal history, a room of minerals, one of birds, mammals, insects. ?..etc. Good way to start a tour of the country.	Historical
Australian Museum	Great natural history museum	If you like Natural History Museums the Australia Museum is is unmissable, comparable to the best of the genre such as London Natural History Museum with the addition of exotic Australian wildlife and a great section on aboriginal culture. We took advantage of a rainy day in Sydney to visit this museum and the Art Gallery of NSW who are only separated by a few blocks and finished the afternoon with a visit to the The Rocks area with its Sunday market and several pubs for good beer and music live.	Historical
Australian Museum	best museum i've been to	I was honestly impressed. The first thing you see is the massive whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling, and the exhibitions on at the time that I was interested in were on skeletons, indiginous Australians, 'surviving Australia' which was about all the native animals, and dinosaurs. The exhibitons were arranged in an interesting way - the facts weren't just presented, but arranged so it drew your attention.	Education
Australian Museum	Great intro to the beginnings of the country	The artifacts and exhibits were interactive and multi faceted. The wildlife and sea creatures that were displayed were awesome to see as a US visitor. The Aboriginal history, customs and folk stories were interesting and educational. I thoroughly enjoyed my day there.	Historical
Australian Museum	So much to see	Give yourself plenty of time to get around, there is so much to see. An interactive program which my grand daughter thoroughly enjoyed and we can't wait to go again soon.	Education
University of Sydney	My favourite place in the world	As a student studying medicine here, you can imagine I spend a great deal of my time here. I love every second of it. As Australia's first university, it has long developed a history of prestige, traditions and culture and it has been consistently ranked in over the top 0.3% of universities in the world. It is the oldest and one of the most prestigious universities in Australia. With the motto, "Sidere mens eadem mutato" literally translated as, "Though the stars change, the mind is eternal", or perhaps more liberally, "Sydney University is really Oxford or Cambridge displaced laterally approximately 12,000 miles". Even its Coat of Arms, granted by Queen Victoria, is a hybrid of those of Oxford and Cambridge, very concretely and ever visibly representing her hopes for what would become Australia's, and indeed, among the worlds most prestigious educational institutions . While it still has much of the traditions inherited from the great British universities, the enduring desire of its founders, the university has also gained its own identity, a uniquely Antipodean character, and together it has grown along with the young country of Australia. The campus is absolutely beautiful, reminiscent and modelled after Oxford and Cambridge and has been ranked in the top 10 of the "Most Beautiful Universities in the World" by the British Telegraph, Huffington Post and even Disney Pixar! The campus is so big, that it even has its own postcode, sprawling across two Sydney suburbs. Explore the largest and most prestigious collection of antiquities in Australia at the Nicholson Museum, or examine the many Art Galleries, collections of natural history or Anatomical museums (some of which may only be open to medical students), all with free admission. Have a picnic in Victoria Park, within the grounds, maybe even take a swim in the Olympic-sized pool, or play a game of tennis, basketball, etc. at the many sports centres, gyms and stadiums on campus.

University of Sydney	Fantastic museums	The MACLEAY MUSEUM in USYD is a great place for kids to go. A lot of collections and also treasure hunting programs for kids. Very educational for kids.	Education
University of Sydney	I love this university	i walked pass this university everyday during my short stay in Sydney. Really love the buildings ! especially when jacaranda was in full bloom, the scenery was splendid.	Cultural
University of Sydney	A special university	It looks and feels like your traditional university down to the ivy growing up the walls. It has all the tradition you expect of our first university and the feel is so different than the newer universities that have proliferated in recent years.	Cultural
University of Sydney	Great place to walk around	I don't go to this Uni but to one that was far less prestigious. With its harry potter like buildings - well sort of, this seems like a nice place to be educated. I visited the Nicholas museum which was pretty cool for a Uni to have.	Education
Wild Life Sydney Zoo	Not to be missed	This is a fantastic place to see all of Australia's indigenous animals in an intimate and friendly atmosphere. Yes its smaller than Taronga Zoo but its less crowded and easier to see the animals in large enclosures and take great photos. They have zoo staff walking around with animals which you can pat and have photos with for free, we saw such reptiles, snakes, a quokka and a possum. This was a great opportunity to find out more info on these great creatures and capture amazing photos. The out back show was also excellent, getting close to birds, reptiles and a baby wombat and we even fed lorikeets. The roof garden is a koala heaven and you can pay to have your photo taken stood next to them but even without paying you can get some great photos. I cannot recommend this place highly enough, especially when bought as part of a combo ticket with other attractions such as the aquarium.	Fun
Wild Life Sydney Zoo	Want to see Australian indigenous animals in sydney?	This place competes with Taronga Zoo only because it is a lot less effort to get here for most visitors to Sydney and therefore takes less time. This is a relatively small zoo. However, that said, I loved the place! All the main Australian animals can be seen here from koalas and kangaroos to echidnas and emus. Many of the animals are fairly easy to photograph, especially some like the reptiles and amphibians. I bought my admission here as part of the combo ticket with the aquarium and thought it a good time.	Fun
Wild Life Sydney Zoo	A zoo with a view	Every visitor to Sydney should take the time to enjoy the beautiful Sydney zoo. We arrived by a short and scenic ferry ride , this zoo is very spacious , clean and has amazing views from the top . Educational and fun shows throughout the grounds . The animals are not kept in cages but rather have areas mimicking there natural habitat so they can roam free.	Fun
Wild Life Sydney Zoo	World of wildlife	Wildlife Sydney Zoo was a great way to see a number of Australian animals in one convenient location. Good views of kangaroos, koalas and cassowary. Staff were friendly. I liked the nocturnal area as this is a group of animals that it is hard to see in their own habitat.	Fun
Wild Life Sydney Zoo	Fun	Great fun for the whole family. Kids enjoyed holding the python for a photo. The only bad thing I can say is the photo counter is terrible understaffed and no idea the staff I actually watched them tell the customer it was an extra $5 and then gave them the photo and moved on to the next customer so those guys got it for free.	Fun
Museum of Contemporary Art	Culture on the rocks	Take an hour out of your Circular Quay sightseeing and pop into the MCA. And why not? It's free and if you visit the 4th floor cafe, you'll be rewarded with great views of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Yeah, the cafe's food is a bit pricey and the art may not be to everyone's taste, but it's a great way to spend a quiet hour in an area heaving with tourists. And I enjoyed the art.	Cultural
Museum of Contemporary Art	Always a wonderful experience	The Museum of Contemporary Art is one of my favourite cultural spaces in Sydney. I try to get there every time I'm in Sydney, and no matter what exhibition is showing, it's always well curated and exhibited, thought-provoking and satisfying. The gallery staff are helpful, friendly and engaging, happy to spend the time discussing and explaining the art. The shop is fantastic - I've spent way too much money there in the past - but it has a great range. I've only checked out the cafe once, and it seemed quite disappointing, but I'll give it another go next time I'm there. Always a great experience.	Cultural
Museum of Contemporary Art	Irritating, beautifully disillusioning 	At first this place may look different than the museum you'd expect, but then it will hit you. A lot of disenchanting pieces that challenge your mind. Aboriginal paintings that start to move when you look at them for a while. A humongous eye watching you so hauntingly you might forget where you are. This is a museum with modern art that is more than a just about provocation or breaking taboos. It is a pretty entertaining and educating place!	Cultural
Museum of Contemporary Art	Pop in for a quick look or meander at your leisure	This fantastic contemporary museum of art features many modern exhibitions from their own collection to eminent guest exhibitions which are always thrilling,challenging and fun. Entry is free except for guest exhibitions. A great space to visit for a short while or a long while, what ever you're in the mood for. Check your bags into concierge & enjoy your contemporary adventure! Suitable for Couples,Solo, Families of all ages & hanging out with friends. Perfectly situated in Circular Quay, you can enjoy the breathtaking views of all Sydney's main attractions - the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Opera House, Circular Quay (where all ferries depart) and across the Harbour to Luna Park & Kirribilly. The MCA cafe is great for refreshments, a quick bite & views, just a short stroll away from The Rocks area- steeped in history where Captain Cook first established Sydney. Check out the MCA's glass elevator. Take a stroll over to see the Opera House about 15min walk. MCA... a great destination what ever the weather!	Cultural
Museum of Contemporary Art	Fun place to browse	This is a very nice museum right next to the Circular Quay. During my visit there was a huge exhibition on stainless steel pieces. Really beautiful and unique.	Cultural
Blues Point Reserve	Came across by accident	And was absolutely wowed away! Felt surreal with a view you felt you could reach out and touch, a glorious sunny day, views galore, didnt know where to look first, as so much to sit and absorb.	Natural
Blues Point Reserve	Great spot to see Sydney	One of the top spots in Sydney to park your car and enjoy the view of Sydney. A small unremarkable park with million dollar views. Park your car and take photos or sit back and enjoy Sydney Harbour. Great photo opportunity for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. You can also walk around to Luna Park and the harbour foreshores.	Natural
Blues Point Reserve	Great views	Stunning view of the Opera House and the harbour bridge. Grab a pizza from the Blues Point Pizza and eat it on the grass with one of the best views of Sydney.	Lazy
Blues Point Reserve	A great view	This little known reserve, at the bottom Blues Point road, offers a different but great view across Sydney Harbour towards the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House on the distant side. A nice reserve to sit back, relax and watch the water craft on the harbour. There is also a small toilet block in the reserve.	Natural
Blues Point Reserve	Watch Sydney go by	Just a nice place to sit and watch - used to go there for lunch all the time when worked in area - many years ago	Lazy
Glebe	My hometown secret	Its always been a gem of a place,with many restaurants,pubs and beautiful walks along the harbourside. There is a little beach along the foreshore where you can take your dog for a swim. The locals are friendly and the eateries are dog friendly too. Good to see that they have progressed with pet friendly venues and finally got into the new millennium down here.Take cash cause a lot of places don't do cards.	Cultural
Glebe	Glebe	Glebe is a funky urban village in the inner west of Sydney. Close to the Sydney CBD, it boasts lots of cool bars, cafes and restaurants and is a great place to hang out on a weekend or a weeknight. On the weekends the Glebe Markets attract people from far and wide to score a bargain or pick up a dstinctive piece of arts and crafts.	Social
Glebe	Close to town but hidden away	Glebe is fantastic it is full of little parkways and water side walks. It is very close to the city but you wouldn't know it! When in Sydney taking a walk along Glebe Point Rd down to the water is well worth it there are lots of cafes and restaurants at an affordable price which makes for a fantastic atmosphere!	Cultural
Glebe	Nice to wander	Wander down the main street, there are plaenty or restaurants & cafes. Also, gallerys & antique shops on and off the main drag. Markets there every Saturday are quite good, a lot of second hand clothes but often there are good quality, hand made items. Definitely try "Friend in Hand" pub. Just a short walk down Cowper Street from Broadway and Glebe Pt Road.	Cultural
Glebe	Nothing to do on a Saturday, visit Glebe	What a wonderful place to visit on a Saturday. If you enjoy the layed back, bohemian lifestyle, then Glebe is the place to visit.This Village becomes alive on a Saturday. If your looking for a place to eat, then there are numerous, multicultural cuisines just waiting to tangtilise your taste buds. If you want a great coffee, you can't beat Mano Cafe on St John's Road, their open from 7am & make the best coffee in Glebe. The local pub, ", The AB Hotel ", (abbrieviation for the Australian British hotel), on the corner of Glebe Point Rd and Pyrmont Bridge Road is a gem. The beer may be a little expensive but the atmosphere and food are to die for. It's a haven for the locals & back packers. You can't miss visiting Glebe markets, held every saturday, there's something to suit all. Glebe has so much to offer, food, art Galleries & culture. Worth a vist !	Cultural
Sydney Olympic Park	Nice to visit	Sydney Olympic Park is nice place to visit. It is important landmark in Sydney for visitors. It is difficult to see all of it in one visit.	Cultural
Sydney Olympic Park	Love this place. So much to see and do. 	We were there for 6 days to watch a swimming competition. What a great venue. During the break of heats and finals for swimming, there was so much to do at the park. Great for kids. Train stops right at the venue. Would go back there in a heartbeat.	Cultural
Sydney Olympic Park	Great for photos!	The Sydney Olympic Park is great for photo opportunities. You'll also get the feel of the old Olympic spirit that was previously held in this city. I remember I visited this site last July 2008 and there is a small monument where you'll see the Olympics logo: a definitely must photograph spot. The Olympic stadium is well maintained and very clean.	Cultural
Sydney Olympic Park	A must see if you love nature and the outdoors	Both Bicentennial Park within the Sydney Olympic Park and Centennial park demonstrate great foresight and vision on the part of planners, public servants and politicians. Public appreciation of these fantastic assets in this wonderful city is demonstrated all day every day by the numbers of people who enjoy this space. If you're a bird watcher (like me), nature lover, walker, cyclist, jogger, enjoy picnics or barbecues, like an informal environment in the city in which to meet friends or family, or like to have time alone, Sydney's Bicentennial Park is highly recommended. There are playgrounds, picnic and barbecue areas, a cafe, cycle paths, walking and running tracks, a bird hide, and Trelliage Tower which has views over Homeush Bay and the city. I love Sydney and, sooner rather than later, plan to return to the wonderful Bicentennial Park with my binoculars semi-glued to my eyes! I will also check out areas not seen during my first visit such as the education centre in the armoury and many additional walking tracks and habitats.	Natural
Sydney Olympic Park	Magic place to explore	We rode our bikes around this awesome complex and can see just why the Sydney Olympics were so successful. Take yourself to the Armory and if there in a weekend go to Bird Life Australia. Extrordinary folk take all the mystery out of bird watching and the Eagle Cam is a must .	Natural
Museum of Sydney	I've been several times	As a long time resident of Sydney, I’d say the Museum of Sydney is the one I visit most often. While it may be small, it does have some interesting exhibitions from time to time, so planning your visit around its website is the best way to see it. Presently there is an exhibition on Iconic Australian houses which my wife and I found so interesting, it took so much time to examine every aspect that we have resolved to save the Celestial exhibit for a separate visit. Contrary to davidmydavid’s comment, it isn’t free but it isn’t expensive either especially for seniors.	Education
Museum of Sydney	Great exhibitions	We visited the Museum of Sydney during a recent overnight stay in the city. It has two exhibitions currently running that are well worth seeing: Suburban Noir: mainly police photographs taken in the '50s and '60s and art based on these photos. The exhibition gives a different and very stark but fascinating view of the era. We loved it.	Historical
Museum of Sydney	Great little museum	This was such a good museum, full of the History of a great city! It had incredible interactive displays and some very informative old film footage. The story line booths were also so interesting.	Historical
Museum of Sydney	Great insight into Sydney's history	Specifically went to see the Maragret Olley exhibition which was terrific. For visitors - both international and local to Sydney - the Museum of Sydney is a lovely space. It gives a thorough insight into the area - pre-settlement and the struggles faced by both indigenous Australians and new Australians. Highly recommend.	Historical
Museum of Sydney	Excellent overview of Sydney's history	I loved everything about this museum. In fact I would have liked to take it home with me. (Disappointingly there isn't a book to buy as a memento.) From the forecourt with the coloured depiction of the original layout of the first Government House to the exhibits inside, this is a superb place to visit. Everything is well planned and there are many aspects of life when Sydney was first colonised to interest everyone. I learned a lot from visiting the Museum of Sydney that I previously had not been aware of. `although I didn't experience it myself, I have been told the cafe is very good too.	Education
Sydney Town Hall	Icon	An important icon, and stunning example of sandstone architecture. Inside contains the world's largest pipe organ. I have performed inside it and it's always been an absolute pleasure. If you have the opportunity to go inside, definitely take it and soak in the lovely architecture.	Historical
Sydney Town Hall	Magnificient	For over 70 years, hundreds of voices from the Combined Churches Choir perform Handels Messiah in the Sydney Town Hall. You get to hear the largest grand organ in the southern hemisphere, a full orchestra and fabulous soloists perform this immortal work. This annual performance happens in the week before Christmas on a Sunday and one other during the week. This is the best opportunity to see, hear and feel the majesty of this fine old building and be a part of one of Sydney's oldest musical tradition. What more could you ask for!	Cultural
Sydney Town Hall	Must see place	just for its history , amazing beautiful piece of architecture Sydney have a wander around the grounds you will be amazed	Historical
Sydney Town Hall	A beautiful building	Some buildings just remind me of historical Australia, and the Sydney Town Hall is one of them. Beautiful columns and a large tower, the building flanked by leafy green trees and presents quite a spectacle. In the entrance alcove is some nice plaques and dedication plates. A nice building in the centre of Sydney and worth a look.	Historical
Sydney Town Hall	Historic Sydney Building	Important historic Sydney building which hosts concerts and meetings. Centrally located right at Town Hall train station. Worth a visit.	Historical
Ku-Ring-Gai Chase	Natural beauty	Ku-Ring-Gai Chase and the National Park is just a natural beauty, Great for walks, families and picnics. Great day out and to get out of Sydney CBD	Natural
Ku-Ring-Gai Chase	Steller beauty, so close to the CBD	There is so much to do and see in this beautiful green space so close to the CBD. Take a picnic and find a lofty spot to look down on the sparkling Pittwater.	Natural
Ku-Ring-Gai Chase	Great national park	Nice walks. Good views from the north end. Good place to go to get out of the city and enjoy nature.	Natural
Ku-Ring-Gai Chase	Great parks, no need to go too far	On the edge of some of Sydney's most prestigious northern suburbs, so easily accessed, though you need a car. Great walking tracks, virgin bush, wildlife for the observant; horse riding trails and stables in the area. A nice bush experience close to town.	Natural
Ku-Ring-Gai Chase	Spectacular	Gorgeous park with spectacular scenery. Definitely recommend a visit here as it is a great area to explore. We had a team building event here followed by a bbq lunch. Perfect setting.	Natural
Chinatown 	Heaven for foodies	There are so many great restaurants & 2 food courts as well. You can get a meal for as little $6. Yum cha, banquets or just a meal are all available. I've eaten at at least 10+ places in the last few years & I couldn't fault any of them for quality or service.	Hungry
Chinatown 	Bustling nighttime adventure	Chinatown at night is one of the highlights of my trip to Sydney. It's a great atmosphere. My favourites were Emperor's Garden Cakes & Bakery, Purikura Photoland and Morning Glory. Emperor's Garden Cakes & Bakery always had a queue for their Cream Puffs so we decided to try them. They were delicious and we queued up almost every night. Purikura...	Hungry
Chinatown 	Chinatown	Great place to take a stroll and have some great food. Interesting to walk through the streets and absorb the culture ! The different stores and cafes are worth checking out. Also take time to check out Paddy's Market on Wednesdays and weekends!	Cultural
Chinatown 	Friday night market experience	Absolutely loved the street vendors. Watched some amazing food being prepared and tasted some unbelievable flavours and foods.	Hungry
Chinatown 	Fun and good value	We did Chinatown at night with a group of friends and had a wonderful time. Enjoy the atmosphere - we felt safe despite some people warning us there was no trouble and the area was well patrolled.	Fun
The Domain	The great outdoors	It is huge with well-taken of lawns. Great for picnics under the numerous big trees. it is next to the Botanical Gardens and the Art Gallery	Natural
The Domain	Ideal	Combine your walk here with a trip to the Art Gallery of NSW. The art collection is fabulous, then you can stroll across the domain, down through the botanic gardens to the opera house.	Lazy
The Domain	Part of Sydney's lungs	The Domain is a lovely green space that connects the Art Gallery to the City. It's small, pleasant to walk through and adjoins the (wonderful) Botanic Gardens. Often used for free events, especially in January, the Domain historically was a space something like speakers'corner in London's Hyde Park, where anyone could get on their soapbox. (It still happens, esp on Sundays). Massive and old Moreton Bay Figs are a feature of the Domain. At sunset, they're often swamped by flying foxes, which look like bats at a distance, but are actually mamals. Don't go too near, however - they certainly bite!!	Natural
The Domain	Nice views across the harbour	Very Pleasant walk, with nice views across the Harbor. In the middle of the afternoon there are many Sydney locals jogging and exercising using the smooth pavement and grass. Very nice view of the Opera House and Sydney Harbor Bridge	Lazy
The Domain	Best route to the art gallery	A great walk, imaginatively landscaped. Great to pass by the team sports in summer, and duck under the flying foxes in the evening.	Lazy
Parliament House	A walk through the past and the present	I was lucky enough to be in Sydney when the NSW Parliament was having an Open Day, where myself and other visitors were able to wander through almost the entire building; a building which is truly impressive and worth a visit on a normal day as well. The Legislative Council and Assembly Chambers are smaller than they look on TV but beautifully furnished, the small anterooms adjacent to the Chambers make you feel as if you are back in the late 1800's and the modern Fountain Court in the heart of the building is an amazing sight. This is truly a wonderful building full of history and modern importance (sitting in the seats in the Legislative Chambers is a goosebump inducing moment) and can be enjoyed by all ages and people of all interests.	Historical
Parliament House	Piece of history	Definitely worth a visit ! Free public lunch time (1pm start) tour runs for 1 hour (Monday-Friday), no bookings required. The guides are informative, info presented in a manner easy to digest for all ages. My kids (9 and 11 yo) and I really enjoyed the experience. Look up their website prior to visiting and ensure there is no sitting ( no tours on those days)	Education
Parliament House	Democracy in action	The building reeks of history, not floor polish, it's in the very heart of the city, in Macquarie Street, and is one of the finest examples of colonial Australian architecture still extant you're likely to see.	Historical
Parliament House	History and now	This place is great to visit, especially if parliament is in session. What better way to get to know a state or country than by sitting in its parliament. Apart from the history this place provides, seeing it working was awesome.	Historical
Parliament House	A visit in history	It was very informative and interesting. Worth a visit by tourists.	Education
Martin Place	More activities	A lovely area to walk through, sit & watch people go by. Many varied activities at different times. Lovely at Christmas. Many shops all around. Beautiful buildings, Hotels & offices surrounding	Lazy
Martin Place	Check out channel 7	Beautiful shops and we were able to watch the Sunrise show being telecast and had our 5 minutes of fame on the show (in the background) and Kochie, Mel and Nat made an appearance out in Martin Place where we able to have chat with them and they signed autographs for us. A must is to enjoy a coffee and cake at the Lindt cafe whilst in Martin Place.	Fun
Martin Place	Sydney city buzz	The old centre of Sydney, where the original post office still stands, although most of it now in the possession of a major hotel chain. Martin place buzzes with city vibe. It is a meeting place, and entertaining place and a destination in it's own right. Plenty of shops and cafes, street entertainment and a prime spot for people watching,	Cultural
Martin Place	Martin Place	Very nice area and heaps of cafes and shopping (not as much as some other places, but enough for me) You can take a rest from walking on seats or steps amongst beautiful trees	Fun
Martin Place	The bars	this place has a excellent night life hidden in hte sub basements of the many offices there i am sure you will find a great place for happy hour on a friday nite here before heading up to kings cross or home	Social
The Star	Best casino	Best casino i*ve been to yet, welcoming staff, good atmosphere, plenty of pokertables (my reason for going), with both high stake and lower stakes for the amataurs. The best thing about the casino in my oppinion is the buffet restaurant, we were there during crismas, splendid buffet, seafoor galore, even oysters all kinds of meat, sushi, free soft drinks and more.	Fun
The Star	Entertainment plus	Star Casino has recently undergone large renovations and is now a huge hub for entertainment. There are great shows at the Capitol Theatre, good parking facilities, restaurants, hotel and everything else you would expect in a casino.	Fun
The Star	A whole lot better	The Star (as it is now called) is a million times better than prior to the refurb. Well worth a visit, and much more in line with a real international casino. The gaming floor is grand, there are also plenty of food and drink options. The shopping underneath is expensive offering all of the top brands. Friday and Saturday evenings are busy, however other nights of the week it is fairly quiet. I definitely recommend when in Sydney.	Fun
The Star	The new face of The Star	The Star is new. Just the lobby is spectacular, added attraction is the restaurant and food arcade and designer shops. I come here almost every month to dine and visit the shopping arcade. Its an elegant and classy atmosphere if you dine at Balla or enjoy the night at their Marquee club. In the bistro they served freshly cooked menus, from steak to any pasta of your choice, and have a wide selection of pastries and cakes made in the premises by the Pastry Chef. Service is friendly and the venue is always presented immaculately. I don't gamble , but I can see its really packed at night, all the tables in the gaming area are crowded and just so crowded every corner. But to come here to dine, then its better to come before 6:00pm to get a parking which is very expensive.	Luxurious
The Star	Nice casino with great food	This casino was big and beautiful, but a manageable size. We wish they had the video blackjack that was not "video game" style, but it was still fun. We ate at the asian restaurant inside the casino and were very pleasantly surprised at the quality and price of the food!	Fun
Kings Cross	Fun	Not much to say. A lot of crazy hooligans having a good time. Nice hotels close by. Easily accessible.	Social
Kings Cross	Great for a night out	Dodgy, dark, seedy, clubs-- kings cross is usually full on a Friday and Saturday night of all kinds of people partying the weekend away	Social
Kings Cross	Soho of Sydney	Reminds me a lot of Soho in London. A very different scene when compared to the CBD but a welcome diversion and some very interesting restaurants, bars and clubs. Not sure I'd want to be there at throwing out time though	Social
Kings Cross	Party Central	Lots of nightclubs, food, lights, people and life.	Social
Kings Cross	Nightclub district	That's all it is. A mix of good and bad clubs and bars, you just need to go where to go. Not necessarily the best place to go for partying as it gets pricey quickly and the crowd and bouncers can get aggressive. Then again, its a nightclub district and that's what you come to expect.	Social
